Showcasing my skills through projects

Hello!

This is my first sql project where I did some exploratory data analysis, using PostgreSQL, on some insurance data I obtained from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/insurance-claim-analysis-demographic-and-health

Here is a simple dashboard I created to visualize some of the datapoints

I've been learning a lot about sql, and although I didn't touch on everything I've learned so far, I plan to keep practicing and putting those skills to test on other projects.

Thanks for checking my project out and as always any feedback is greatly appreciated!
